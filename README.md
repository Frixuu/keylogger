# keylogger

This simple script shows a popup window on the screen whenever one of the trigger words has been typed.

The original motivation behind it was to stop my grandma from providing her personal info to some sketchy websites. :unamused:

Requires:

- Python 3
- tkinter
- keyboard [(the library)](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard)
- (also an actual keyboard would be preferable)

Note that on Linux you have to run this as root (keyboard package limitation).
